### Run the Blueprint Example

Run
```sh
go generate ./gtk4/blueprint/
```
before executing the usual `go run ./gtk4/blueprint/` command, to generate the `.ui` file from the blueprint.

Make sure that you have [blueprint-compiler](https://jwestman.pages.gitlab.gnome.org/blueprint-compiler/) installed.
